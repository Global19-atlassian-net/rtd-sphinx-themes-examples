***********************************
Read the Docs Sphinx Theme Examples
***********************************

The goal of this project is to illustrate what documentation looks like with different `Sphinx`_ themes when built locally and when built by `Read the Docs`_.

.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org
.. _Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org


Organization
============

This repository is organized such that the documentation for different branches is built with a different Sphinx theme.

* ``master``: https://rtd-sphinx-theme-sample-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (`Read the Docs theme`_)
* ``alabaster``: https://rtd-sphinx-theme-sample-project.readthedocs.io/en/alabaster/ (`Alabaster theme`_)

.. _Read the Docs theme: https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme/
